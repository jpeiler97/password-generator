# password-generator

For this homework assignment I was required to refactor existing code for a password generator, which wasn't functional, using Javascript. The user is to answer prompts for how long they would like their password, and which types of characters they want to include. First, I initialized 4 arrays each containing character types. I created a function that prompts for the length of the password and which character types to use. I created a function that stores all characters from each type the user chose, creates a password by randomly selecting from that array, then splices one of each chosen character type to ensure those types are somewhere in the password. When the user clicks the generate button, it triggers a function that calls my functions nested inside.
